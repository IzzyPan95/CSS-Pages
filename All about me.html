    <h1>How it all started</h1>
    <p>Hey! Thanks for stopping by to my site I thought it might be interesting to create a site that give some information about myself.
        As well as why I decided to choose this career path. I want to say it began when my dad got hooked on phonics when I was kid that I becamed fasicnated with computers. Not to mention his role in studying the electronics field is what also spurred my interets about 
        technolgy. However, I've decided to choose a more ideal and very little labor career which I prefer.</p><br>
