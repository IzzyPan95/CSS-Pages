    <h1><h1>Seeing The World!</h1>

    <p>Unfortunately, I haven't been around the world as much as I would like. I'm told it's never to late to try new things
        and I'm a firm believe in doing so. Last year I took my first ever major out of the country trip to South Korea. The 
        whole expierence was amazing, yet the only dreadful part it all was the flight getting there and the flight leaving! It's take rouhgly 
        thirteen hours!
